# Overview
This project demonstrates how to detect anomalies in stock price data using machine learning and statistical methods.  
Implemented within a Jupyter Notebook, it walks through collecting stock data, preprocessing, analyzing trends, detecting anomalies, and visualizing results.

---

# Motivation
Anomalies in stock prices — sharp spikes or dips — can signal earnings surprises, market shocks, or other unexpected events.  
Detecting such deviations can be vital for risk management, trading strategies, and understanding market behavior.

# Dataset
Stock price data is fetched using APIs like **`yfinance`**, which provides historical metrics such as:

- Open  
- High  
- Low  
- Close  
- Adjusted Close  
- Volume  

Data typically spans a user-defined time range.

# Methodology

## 1. Data Collection
Retrieve historical stock data using `yfinance` (or similar) by specifying ticker symbols and date ranges.

## 2. Preprocessing
- Convert dates to datetime and set as index  
- Handle missing values (imputation or removal)  
- Add derived features: daily returns, moving averages, volatility, etc.

## 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Visualize time-series patterns using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** to study price trends, volume changes, and volatility.

## 4. Anomaly Detection Techniques
- **Z-Score**: Standardize data; flag points beyond a threshold (e.g., \|Z\| > 2)  
- Advanced methods (optional):
    - Isolation Forest  
    - DBSCAN  
    - Autoencoders or LSTM-based methods  

## 5. Visualization
- Price anomalies marked in **red**  
- Volume anomalies marked in **orange**  
- Overlaid plots for comparative insight

## 6. Evaluation (Optional)
If ground truth exists, evaluate detection quality with:
- Precision  
- Recall  
- F1-score
